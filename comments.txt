here we add new annotations which are interfaces which be called starting with "@".
it is a part of AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming).
where we can place the annotation to make the code clear and easy to read and spotless.
then we can add the implementation independently where it is called where ever the interface is invoked.
that happens by declaring the @Aspect and where to call it - @Around
Since the spring boot is complex and sophisticated framework , we can get the attributes of a certain
connection to the HTTP server and extract what we want from it - this is via getAttribute()
