# Getting Started

## What is This ?

This is a spring boot project done for educational and training purposes.
It aims to deal with Authorization and Authentication.
Whereas many junior devs and engineers (as of myself) know how to implement complex back-end logic ensuring
high standards, there are some basic concepts those are not related to the business itself
sometimes go missing.
so I created a simple project to deal with authentication and authorization
in addition to some other general concepts like AOP, JsonSerializing, DTOs
just enough to use them and make the project works as basic logic.

## Acronyms
we will use :
* AuthZ for authorization 
* AuthN for authentication

## Branching
* Master branch will have the project working just fine with only AuthZ
  * since operational AuthZ will be the same regardless of AuthN
  * AuthZ will be JWT since it is most widely used and proved its efficiency
